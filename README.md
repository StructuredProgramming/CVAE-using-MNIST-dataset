This is the code for a Conditional Variational Autoencoder on the MNIST Dataset, allowing it to generate new images of the digits 0-9 which are part of the dataset, extending it beyond the traditional capabilities of a Variational Autoencoder.
Since the images are 28x28, only fully-connected layers are used, convolutional layers are not necessary.
